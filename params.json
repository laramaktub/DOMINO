INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDOMINO is a new software application specifically designed for improving the development of\r\nDNA markers in non-model organisms using either NGS data or pre-computed multiple sequence \r\nalignments (MSA) in various formats (including MSA from RAD data). \r\n\r\nWe used Perl and C++ scripting languages to combine some popular, open-source, bioinformatics\r\ntools for NGS data with a set of new developed functions in an integrated bioinformatics\r\npipeline for custom-made marker discovery or selection. \r\n\r\nUsing NGS data (raw or pre-processed reads) from typical genome partitioning or low depth\r\nsequencing experiments (including or not reference sequences, such as, for example, genome\r\nscaffolds), or pre-computed multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of multiple taxa \r\n(“taxa panel”, which may represent different populations or species), DOMINO searches for \r\nsequence regions with a minimum level of variation, which can be optionally flanked by \r\nstretches of conserved sequences (appropriate for further PCR primers design). \r\n\r\nThe DOMINO workflow consists in four main phases: “Input Data” and “Pre-processing”, \r\n“Assembly”, “Alignment/Mapping” and “Marker Discovery/Selection”. Users can enter to the \r\nDOMINO workflow at different points in order to perform specific shortcut runs for marker \r\ndiscovery or selection according to the type of input data.\r\n\r\nIn a typical full run from raw NGS reads (using marker identification and marker selection \r\nmodules), the program applies an assembly-based approach; the pipeline is therefore \r\noptimized to work with genome partitioning methods in which the size-selected or enriched \r\nfragments are long enough to permit a successful assembly and have been fully (or nearly \r\nfully) sequenced. For MSA inputs, as for example, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) \r\nvariation and related methods (e.g. RADseq, ddRAD, GBS) DOMINO can searh the MSA of each \r\nloci (in this case RAD loci) previously obtained with commonly used software packages for \r\nhighly informative markers (marker selection module); current version accepts the PHYLIP \r\nand FASTA format as well as the pyRAD (*.loci) and STACKS (*.fa) output file formats. \r\n\r\nAfter the maker development phase, DOMINO provides i) the list the genomic regions (with \r\ntheir corresponding coordinates in each contig) exhibiting the minimum levels of nucleotide \r\nvariation specified by the user among the selected taxa (or covering at least a pre-defined \r\nminimum number of them), and the marker MSAs for these taxa (DOMINO marker identification \r\nmodule) or ii) the list of markers exhibiting the same pre-definable features among a set \r\nof aligned sequences supplied by the user and previously obtained in other software (DOMINO\r\n marker selection module). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the taxa panel has been designed in a convenient phylogenetic context \r\nand the user asks for highly conserved regions flanking to be included in the developed \r\nmarkers, these markers should be suitable for further surveys of variation in an extended \r\nset of phylogenetically related taxa, i.e. “focal taxa”. \r\n\r\n#2. INSTALLATION\r\n\r\n## 2.1. Supported Operating Systems\r\n\r\nDOMINO is developed and maintained under GNU/Unix using ANSI/ISO C and standard \r\ndevelopment tools (GCC, Autotools).\r\n\r\nIt can be compiled and run in Linux (it has been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) and \r\nMac OSX systems (version > 10.10)\r\n\r\n## 2.2. Requirements\r\n\r\n- Perl Programming Language version v5.2+\r\n\r\n- C++ compiler\r\n\t+ Mac OS users may need to install Xcode package via App Store\r\n\t+ Linux users may need to install build essential package o g++ compiler\r\n\t\tUbuntu:\r\n\t\t\tsudo apt-get install build-essential \r\n\t\t\tor \r\n\t\t\tsudo apt-get install g++\r\n\r\n- zlib compression library v1.2.3+ (SAMtools dependency) <http://www.zlib.net/>\r\n\t+ Mac OS: included and installed in the distribution.\r\n\t+ Linux users may need to install zlib1g-dev package\r\n\t\tUbuntu/Linux Mint:\r\n\t\t\tsudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev\r\n\t\t\t\r\n- Xterm (in some ubuntu-like distributions may not be included):\r\n\t+ Mac OS: included and installed in the distribution\r\n\t+ Ubuntu/Linux Mint:\r\n\t\tsudo apt-get install xterm\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2.3. Installation\r\n\r\nTwo possible installation options:\r\n\r\n### 2.3.1. DOMINO GUI plus Command-line version:\r\n\r\nAll necessary installation files and folders are available form the domino git directory \r\nor the website. The installer will guide user through the complete installation process.\r\n\t\t\r\nThe bin directory will contain the DOMINO perl scripts, the directories with the binaries \r\nof the external software included in the DOMINO pipeline and some mandatory Perl modules. \r\nIn addition, a shortcut Desktop DOMINO icon will be generated.\r\n\r\n### 2.3.2. Command-line:\r\n\r\nIn the git directory, the user can find a pre-configured shell script (install.sh) written\r\nto handle the installation of command-line version (please, notice that only the \r\ncommand-line version should be installed using this option).\r\n\r\nIn a Unix-based bash console, change the directory to fit the desired installation folder \r\nand run the script, with 'sh install.sh'\r\n\t\r\nThe bin directory will contain the DOMINO perl scripts, the directories with the binaries \r\nof the external software included in the DOMINO pipeline and some mandatory Perl modules.\r\n\r\n# 2. BUG REPORTS\r\n\r\nIf you encounter bugs that are not listed here, please send a\r\nreport to the main authors.\r\n  \t\r\n   \tJ.F.Sanchez: jfsanchezherrero@ub.edu\r\n\tA.Sanchez-Gracia: elsanchez@ub.edu\r\n   \tJ.Rozas: jrozas@ub.edu \r\n\r\n\r\n# 3. COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see a new feature implemented, send\r\nsuggestions to the main authors (See AUTHORS). Our aim is to have an\r\n\"asked features\" framework soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 4.
